# C-Deep-Reinforcement-Learning
Deep Reinforcement Learning programmed in C using only GSL Math Library

##How to use

If you insist on running it (I don't know why you would use this over TensorFlow) you can compile it using your favorite compiler, just compile main.c, neuralNetwork.h and neuralNetwork.c

##FAQ/Comments

###Why did you do this?
I have spent the last 3-4 years studying and researching Machine Learning and I wanted to apply it.

###Why did you not use a library like TensorFlow?
I want to understand the fundamentals of how Machine Learning works

###You did this and that inefficently
I understand that I might have done somethings in a slower way, but my highest formal education, as of writing this, is pre-calculus. But if you have suggestions, please let me know!
